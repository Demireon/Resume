# Resume
My resume, written in Latex

## Motivation
I wanted to rewrite my resume and take in future extensiblity for the content into view, so I wanted to shy away from Word or Google Docs. By writing it in Latex, I can rapidly change the content without worrying about the formatting in the future.

Huge shoutout to Sourabh Bajaj, as I pulled much of the formatting from his resume. Feel free to check it out here - https://github.com/sb2nov/resume

Format is MIT, but the data is owned by me.
